  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello, 
    I am currently working as a Senior Research Engineer & Managing Director of CICI at Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas. 
    I received his Doctorate from Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Texas A&M University, USA, Master of 
    Technology in Civil Engineering (Geotechnical) from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, India and Bachelor in Civil Engineering
    from Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST), Kolkata, India. My doctoral research was primarily focused 
    on the application of novel materials to improve the performance of inferior geomaterials and expansive soils in particular. 
    During his doctoral studies, I was also extensively involved in several other projects related to the in-situ application of other 
    novel construction materials such as geosynthetics and geopolymers. During my M.Tech, I worked on numerical and analytical
    modeling for improving the bearing capacity of shallow foundations using geotextile reinforcement. My current research interest 
    includes soil stabilization, ground improvement, application of geosynthetics, and the development of sustainable and resilient infrastructures.</p>
