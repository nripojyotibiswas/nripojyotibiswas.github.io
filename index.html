  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I am currently working as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at University of Massasschusets Lowell (UML).
  
    My doctoral research was primarily focused on the application of novel materials to improve the performance of inferior geomaterials and expansive soils in particular. 
    During his doctoral studies, I was also extensively involved in several other projects related to the in-situ application of other 
    novel construction materials such as geosynthetics and geopolymers. During my M.Tech, I worked on numerical and analytical
    modeling for improving the bearing capacity of shallow foundations using geotextile reinforcement. My current research interest 
    includes soil stabilization, ground improvement, application of geosynthetics, and the development of sustainable and resilient infrastructures.</p>
